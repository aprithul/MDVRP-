# MDVRP-GA
An Multi Depot Vehicle Routing Problem solver using Genetic Algorithm.  GA code is implemented in C++ and then compiled with Emscripten to web assembly.
Contents:
  1. C-mdvrp -> Contains benchmark problems by Cordeau
  2. Emscripten -> The compiler
  3. ga -> C++ genetic algorithm code to solve MDVRP
  4. Web Application -> html/js web application. Uses plotly for graphing.
 
The web application can parse the benchmark problems.
